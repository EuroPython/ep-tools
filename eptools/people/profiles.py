    Parameters
    ----------
    fetch_data: bool
        If True will download the data from the web server.

    conf: str
        The string identifying the conference.

    host: str
        The IP address to where the web server is.
        These parameters might not be enough to set up the connection to the
        server to download the data.

        Note:
        You may want to check the server_utils.epcon_fetch_file function:
        change the default arguments or make them available through this
        function.

    talk_status: str
        choices: 'proposed', 'accepted'
        In the end this should be 'accepted'
        Be careful, if the talks.json file is already downloaded with not
        accepted talks and `fetch_data` is False the result won't be correct.
        You need to either set `fetch_data` to True or download a new talks.json
        file with the accepted talks.
