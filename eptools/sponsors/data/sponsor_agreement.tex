{{ package_description }}

\vspace{2cm}

\large\textbf{Sponsorship amount ("Package Fee"):} {{ cost_without_vat }} EUR plus VAT at

\vfill{}
\pagebreak{}

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{VAT}}

VAT at the applicable rate will be applied to each of the selected services and
options.

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Payment}}

Invoices for the Sponsor Package will be issued by the EuroPython Society,
Göteborg, Sweden, having the EU VAT-ID SE802417770401 and VAT registered

The Package Fee becomes due and earned upon receiving the invoice for the

days after the invoice date in Euro (EUR) to the following EPS bank account:


\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
\textbf{Bank name} & SEB AB (publ), Stockholm, Sweden\tabularnewline

\hline
\textbf{Swift code (SWIFT)} & ESSESESS\tabularnewline
\hline
\end{tabular}
\par\end{center}

The invoice is considered to be received by the recipient on the same day, if
sent by email, and 5 days after it was submitted to the post office, if sent by
first class mail. Objections to the invoice have to be made within 8 calendar
days of the receipt of the invoice.

Overdue payments incur an interest of 18\% per annum, to be invoiced by the
creditor separately.

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Representation}}

The signing Sponsor representatives warrant and represent that the sponsor
details given above are true and correct and that they have authority to enter
into this agreement and to perform all obligations hereunder.


\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Limited Availability}}

The number of certain packages available is limited to the number
shown in the brochure. Availability of such packages is strictly on
a ‘first come, first served’ basis. Where such a limited package is
unavailable, an alternative package may be mutually agreed.


\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Sponsorship Offer}}

By submitting this agreement the Sponsor offers to purchase the selected
Sponsorship Package subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement. The
Organizers are free to accept or decline this offer. The Organizers accept the
offer by confirmation email and by issuing an invoice for the selected
Sponsorship Package to the above billing address, making the agreement binding.

\vfill{}
\pagebreak{}

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Business Relationship}}

The Sponsor confirms that this agreement is solely business-to-business (B2B).
The Sponsor is a registered business, not a consumer and ordering the
sponsorship package solely for its business activities. This Agreement does not
create a partnership relationship between the parties.

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Conference Passes}}

Participation in the event EuroPython 2018 shall be requested separately by
application via the conference website. Where a sponsorship package contains
free admission to the event or admission at reduced rates, the Organizers will
provide Sponsor with corresponding vouchers which may be used when registering
for the event.

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Deadlines}}

For services in which the Organizers need materials from the Sponsor, the
Sponsor will have to meet the delivery deadlines set for said materials. This
is especially crucial for services such as: printing the advertisement page in
the conference brochure, delivery of bag inserts to the venue, etc. The
Organizers will publish the delivery deadlines for each service on the
following URL: https://ep2018.europython.eu/en/sponsor/information/.
The Organizers cannot guarantee the fulfillment of the service, if these
deadlines are not met by the Sponsor.

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Limited Liability}}

To the extent legally permissible, the Organizers’ liability is limited to the
direct and foreseeable damage typical for this type of contract and the
Organizers’ liability for damages hereunder shall in no event exceed the amount
of fees paid by Sponsor under this Agreement. The foregoing shall not be
interpreted as in any way limiting the Organizers’ liability for damage caused
intentionally or due to gross negligence, nor for personal injury.

In providing the services hereunder, the Organizers are responsible for the
services performance only and do not make any representation as to their effect
or suitability for any particular purpose, which remains solely the economic
and business risk of the Sponsor.

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Social events and food distribution}}

Any social gathering or event to be organized by the Sponsor inside any of the
conference venues must be communicated and approved by the Organizers.
Any kind of food and/or drink distribution by the Sponsor must be communicated
and approved by the Organizers. The Organizers reserve the right to deny approval
or cancel any of these events without requirement to refund nor pay any type of
expenses or damages.

\vfill{}
\pagebreak{}

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Offer Non-Exclusive}}

The Sponsor acknowledges that the services are non-exclusive and competitors
of the Sponsor may take part in the event and take out similar sponsorship
packages.

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Cancellation}}

Provision of the services is dependent on the event itself taking place. Should
the Organizers need to cancel the whole or parts of the event for a reason in
its reasonable control, the Organizers’ liability is limited to a corresponding
reduction or return of the amount of fees paid and the Organizers shall refund
to the Sponsor the corresponding amount of the fee paid.

The Sponsor’s commitment, by agreement of the sponsorship package, is central
to the Organizers’ planning of the event. In the case of cancellation by
Sponsor prior to the event, this shall not relieve the Sponsor from the
liability for full payment of the fees, despite any loss to the Sponsor of
benefits from the sponsoring package which thereby occur.

The Organizers are not responsible if the event is canceled in whole or in part
for reasons not within their reasonable control, including acts of God, labour
disputes, civil commotion or other event of such effect that carrying out or
continuation of the event would be unreasonable in the circumstances. The
Organizers shall not be obliged to re-organize the event.

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{Conduct}}

Sponsor and its representatives at the conference shall act in accordance with
the EuroPython 2018 Code of Conduct \protect\footnote{The EuroPython 2018 Code
of Conduct is available on the website on the following URL:
\protect\href{https://ep2018.europython.eu/coc/}{https://ep2018.europython.eu/coc/}}.

The Organizers reserve the right to withdraw from this agreement, at their sole
discretion and without any further liability, if, in their own opinion, Sponsor
or its representatives do not comply to the above code of conduct.

The Organizers further reserve the right to ask Sponsor or its representatives
to leave the conference in such a case, without requirement to refund the
Package Fee or part thereof.

The Sponsor will:

\begin{itemize}
\item adhere to the applicable laws regulating data protection, the Processing of Personal Data and privacy of EU citizens, including the EU Directive 95/46/EC and from 25 May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (as amended or replaced from time to time), collectively, the “Data Protection Legislation”; the terms Data Subjects, Personal Data, Process, Processed, Processing, Sensitive Personal Data, Special Personal Data, Supervisory Authority, Data Controller or Data Processor, where capitalised, shall have the meanings in, and shall be interpreted in accordance with, the Data Protection Legislation;
\item procure that collection of Personal Data of any Data Subject(s) at or in context of the event is only done subject to prior explicit consent by the Data Subject(s) and only after making a copy of the Sponsors’ privacy policy available to the Data Subject(s);
\item procure that Sponsor’s privacy policy follows and implements the rules and regulations set forth in the Data Protection Legislation, in particular, documenting which data is being collected and for which purpose this data will be used;
\item record whether consent was given in respect of each processing purpose by each Data Subject and provide that information including a copy of the auditable record of consent acquired (and including any Personal Data in respect of which consent to share with the Organizers has been obtained) to the Organizers on demand, within five (5) working days;
\item provide a procedure and contact by which the Organizers can request removal or correction of Personal Data stored by the Sponsor, should Data Subject(s) request this from the Organizer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{\textcolor{grey}{General Provisions}}

Sponsor and Organizers have agreed on English as the controlling language for
this agreement.

Any amendment to this agreement shall be valid only if made in writing,
including any dispensation of the requirement of the written form.

This agreement will be governed by and shall be construed in accordance with
the laws of Sweden. It shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for International Sale of Goods. Any dispute or claim arising out
of or in connection with this agreement, or breach thereof, shall be submitted
to the jurisdiction of the courts of Gothenburg, Sweden.

If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason
unenforceable, such provision shall be modified to the extent necessary to
render it enforceable without losing its intent, or, if no such modification is
possible, be severed from this Agreement and shall not affect the validity and
enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement.
