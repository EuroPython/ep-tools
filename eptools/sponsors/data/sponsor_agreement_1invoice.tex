\subsection*{Sponsorship Offer}

By submitting this agreement the Sponsor offers to purchase the selected
Sponsorship Package subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement.
The Organizers are free to accept or decline this offer. The Organizers
accept the offer by confirmation email and by issuing an invoice for
the selected Sponsorship Package to the above billing address, making
the agreement binding.


\subsection*{Business Relationship}

The Sponsor confirms that this agreement is solely business-to-business
(B2B). The Sponsor is a registered business, not a consumer and ordering
the sponsorship package solely for its business activities. This Agreement
does not create a partnership relationship between the parties.


\subsection*{Conference Passes}

Participation in the event EuroPython 2016 shall be requested separately
by application via the Organisers’ website. Where a sponsorship package
contains free admission to the event or admission at reduced rates,
the Organisers will provide Sponsor with corresponding vouchers which
may be used when registering for the event.


\subsection*{Limited Liability}

To the extent legally permissible, the Organisers’ liability is limited
to the direct and foreseeable damage typical for this type of contract
and the Organisers’ liability for damages hereunder shall in no event
exceed the amount of fees paid by Sponsor under this Agreement. The
foregoing shall not be interpreted as in any way limiting the Organisers’
liability for damage caused intentionally or due to gross negligence,
nor for personal injury. In providing the services hereunder, the
Organisers are responsible for the services performance only and do
not make any representation as to their effect or suitability for
any particular purpose, which remains solely the economic and business
risk of the Sponsor.


\subsection*{Offer Non-Exclusive}

The Sponsor acknowledges that the services are non-exclusive and competitors
of the Sponsor may take part in the event and take out similar sponsorship
packages.

\subsection*{Cancellation }

Provision of the services is dependent on the event itself taking
place. Should the Organisers need to cancel the whole or parts of
the event for a reason in its reasonable control, the Organisers’
liability is limited to a corresponding reduction or return of the
amount of fees paid and the Organizers shall refund to the Sponsor
the corresponding amount of the fee paid.

The Sponsor’s commitment, by agreement of the sponsorship package,
is central to the Organizers’ planning of the event. In the case of
cancellation by Sponsor prior to the event, this shall not relieve
the Sponsor from the liability for full payment of the fees, despite
any loss to the Sponsor of benefits from the sponsoring package which
thereby occur.

The Organizers are not responsible if the event is cancelled in whole
or in part for reasons not within their reasonable control, including
acts of God, labour disputes, civil commotion or other event of such
effect that carrying out or continuation of the event would be unreasonable
in the circumstances. The Organizers shall not be obliged to re-organize
the event.


\subsection*{Conduct }

Sponsor and its representatives at the conference shall act in accordance
with the Code of Conduct of EuroPython 2016: https://ep2016.europython.eu/en/coc/

The Organizers reserve the right to withdraw from this agreement,
at their sole discretion and without any further liability, if, in
their own opinion, Sponsor or its representatives do not comply to
the above code of conduct


\subsection*{General Provisions}

Sponsor and Organizers have agreed on English as the controlling language
for this agreement.

Any amendment to this agreement shall be valid only if made in writing,
including any dispensation of the requirement of the written form.

This agreement will be governed by and shall be construed in accordance
with the laws of Spain. It shall not be governed by the United Nations
Convention on Contracts for International Sale of Goods. Any dispute
or claim arising out of or in connection with this agreement, or breach
thereof, shall be submitted to the courts of Bizkaia.

If any provision of this Agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for
any reason unenforceable, such provision shall be modified to the
extent necessary to render it enforceable without losing its intent,
or, if no such modification is possible, be severed from this Agreement
and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement.
