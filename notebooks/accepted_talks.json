Design your architecture to use cloud computing, so your tiny team can scale up your huge ideas. \r\n\r\nOr keep it small, and just earn some extra money with a Wordpress plugin, or a training course.\r\n\r\nIt has been 21 years since I last had a 'real job' and a regular income. \r\n\r\nI survived creating and running a company through the madness of the dotcom years.  I made money from sideprojects, that I had started just for fun and for learning.

What made Python suitable for science; How could scipy grow to challenge commercial giants such as Matlab; Why the cultural gap between scientific Python and the broader Python community turned out to be a gold mine; How scikit-learn was born, what technical decisions enabled it to grow; And last but not least, how we are addressing a wider and wider public, lowering the bar and empowering people.\r\n\r\nThe talk will discuss low-level technical aspects, such as how the Python world makes it easy to move large chunks of number across code.

        "#(Machine-)Learning Chinese, with Python!\r\n\r\nLearning a new language is hard work. Especially if it is Chinese, which is a tonal language that is written using more than 10.000 different characters. Finding our way around in this linguistic labyrinth is a daunting task. But do not fear, for we have the power of Python at our side, and with its help we will **machine-learn Chinese**!\r\n\r\n## Mom scolds the horse \r\n\r\nChinese is a tonal language, which means that pronouncing a syllable differently will usually change its meaning. And while this can be very funny, it can also be rather embarrassing for language learners. So, to keep us from getting into linguistic trouble, we'll write a little Python tool that helps us to improve our pronunciation.\r\n\r\n## Seeing the trees and the forest, but still being lost\r\n\r\nReading the morning newspaper while having a nice cup of tea doesn't sound so complicated, does it? Well, if that newspaper is printed in Chinese we will have to know about 2.500 characters just to make it through the first pages. Again, machine-learning will come to our rescue!\r\n\r\n## Low-hanging fruits, high-flying dragons\r\n\r\nPronunciation and characters mastered, we'll still have to learn a large amount of words and phrases, so where to begin? To answer this, we'll make use of Bayesian techniques to identify the low-hanging fruits of the Chinese language.\r\n\r\nCongratulations, you should now be fluent in Chinese (or at least Machine-Learning)."

Also, Chinese is a fascinating topic by itself and something that many people can relate to as Chinese culture becomes more pervasive around the world.\r\n\r\nMy idea is therefore to do a tutorial in which people can apply different machine learning methods to problems that we encounter in language learning. I selected three specific problems (voice recognition, image classification, text processing) for this, which in my opinion are very well suited to a machine-learning approach and produce interesting and relevant results while being easy to explain and understand on a basic level.\r\n\r\nI also would like to give a talk about the material that we cover in the tutorial such that a wider audience can enjoy it, I therefore also submitted a proposal for a summary talk (with the same title). \r\n\r\nI already spoke at many IT & scientific conferences and usually received very good audience feedback for my talks (but maybe people are just very polite :D ), a selection of my talks and publications can be found on my website: http://www.andreas-dewes.de/talks.html\r\n\r\nI also have more than 7 years of experience in using Python for data analysis and I really enjoy teaching, which I have done both at University and professionally in my job.",

We will also discuss tools and techniques to optimize your code for speed and memory performance.\r\n\r\nThe tutorial will overview working with the common parallel communication technologies (threading, multiprocessing, MPI) and introduce the use of parallel programming models such as blocking and non-blocking pipes, asynchronous and iterative conditional maps, and map-reduce. We will discuss strategies for extending parallel workflow to utilize hierarchical and heterogeneous computing, distributed parallel computing, and job schedulers. We then return our focus to the speeding up our target code by leveraging parallelism within compiled code using Cython.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the tutorial, participants should be able to write simple parallel Python scripts, make use of effective parallel programming techniques, and have a framework in place to leverage the power of Python in High-Performance Computing.",

Python 2.6 or 3.3/3.4\r\nshould also work. Python 3.x is strongly preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n### IPython Notebook\r\n\r\nI will use an IPython Notebook for the tutorial because it makes a very good\r\nteaching tool. You are welcome to use the setup you prefer, i.e editor, IDE,\r\nREPL. If you also like to use an IPython Notebook, I recommend `conda` for\r\neasy installation. Similarly to `virtualenv`, `conda` allows creating isolated\r\nenvironments but allows binary installs for all platforms.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to install`IPython` via `conda`:\r\n\r\n1. Use [Minconda][1]. This is a  small install and (after you installed it)\r\n   you can use the command  `conda` to create an environment:\r\n  `conda create -n pycon2016 python=3.5`\r\n   Now you can change into this environment:\r\n   `source activate pycon2016`. The prompt should change to `(pycon2016)`.\r\n   Now you can install IPython: `conda install IPython`.\r\n\r\n2. Install [Anaconda][2] and you are ready to go if you don't mind installing\r\n   lots of packages from the scientific field.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second option also gives you `conda` and you can create more environments\r\njust as with Miniconda (see 1.).\r\n\r\n### Working witch ``conda`` environments\r\n\r\nAfter creating a new environment, the system might still work with some\r\nstale settings. Even when the command ``which`` tells you that you are using an\r\nexecutable from your environment, this might actually not be the case.\r\nIf you see strange behavior using a command line tool in your environment,\r\nuse ``hash -r`` and try again. Please install ``pip`` inside this environment:\r\n\r\n      conda install pip\r\n\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\nYou can install these with ``pip`` (in the active ``conda`` environment):\r\n\r\n* [SnakeViz][3]\r\n* [line_profiler][4]\r\n* [Pympler][6]\r\n* [memory_profiler][7]\r\n* [pyprof2calltree][9]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\nUsing the package manager of your OS should be the best option.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html\r\n[2]: http://continuum.io/downloads\r\n[3]: http://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/\r\n[4]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/line_profiler/\r\n[6]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pympler\r\n[7]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/memory_profiler\r\n[8]: http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Home.html\r\n[9]: https://github.com/pwaller/pyprof2calltree/\r\n\r\n## About the trainer\r\n\r\nI've been teaching Python courses since 2004. According to my statistics,\r\nI taught about 250 Python courses totaling over 600 teaching day.\r\nThis includes 16 tutorials at PyCon as well as numerous tutorials at\r\nEuroPython, EuroSciPy, PyCon DE, PyCon PL, PyCon IE, PyCon AsiaPacific\r\nas well as at PyData London and Berlin.\r\n\r\nI've been teaching tutorials about this topic every year at PyCon US from 2007\r\nthrough 2014 as well at PyData Berlin 2015 and at EuroPython 2015 in Bilbao.\r\nThis version has been revised **based on the feedback from the last tutorial\r\ndeliveries**.\r\n\r\nFirst, the tutorial covers fewer topics. I cut out tools that do not support\r\nPython 3 such as SnakeRunSnake and Heapy.\r\n\r\nSecond, I added more exercises. This should allow more focus on the core of the\r\ntutorial and also include more hands-on work by the participants. This \u201eLess is\r\nMore\u201c approach is additionally justified because the content of the tutorial\r\ngrew over time as more very useful tools became available. I think more\r\ndepths and less range makes sense for this topic.\r\n\r\nThere is a 60-page PDF handout that is rather comprehensive and can serve for\r\nself-study after the tutorial.\r\n",

And there's a host of successful natural language processing examples out there. What's the underlying theme? They all use Deep Learning.\r\n\r\nThis workshop introduces artificial neural networks and deep learning. The building blocks of neural networks are discussed in detail. Attendees are introduced to learning using ANN with backpropagation algorithm.\r\n\r\nA preliminary model using multi-layer perceptron is implemented to get a feel for deep learning model structure and the library keras.\r\n\r\nThe state-of-art recurrent neural networks is introduced. Two approaches are shown - 0ne using Long Short-Term Memory models and another one leveraging Word2Vec. Some ways to overcome overfitting are explored. \r\n\r\nWe'll also show how GPU's affect the computation.\r\n\r\nWe'll also implement a RNN to do text-generation.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Ideal Background of the attendee**\r\n\r\nSome knowledge of machine learning. \r\n - Bias and Variance\r\n - Train, Validation, and Test sets\r\n - Cross-validation\r\n - hyperparameter optimization\r\n - Measuring model accuracy \r\n - Supervised and Unsupervised learning\r\n - Overfitting \r\n - Basic Python constructs\r\n\r\nThe repository for the tutorial is [here][1]\r\n\r\nThe repository has instructions on what packages to install and the data we would be using for the workshop.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/rouseguy/intro2deeplearning\r\n",

        "The [Cython][1] compiler is an excellent and widely used tool for speeding up computational code and talking to native libraries. It translates Python code to C or C++ code and supports static type annotations to allow direct use of C/C++ data types, native functions and complex array types. The tight integration of all three languages makes it possible to freely mix Python features like generators and comprehensions with C/C++ features like native data types, pointer arithmetic or manually tuned memory management in the same code. Cython has direct support for NumPy arrays and other buffer objects, which allows for efficient and even parallel (OpenMP) processing of large arrays.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial by a Cython core developer introduces the Cython programming language and its compiler and leads the participants all the way from their first Python extension to an efficient integration with NumPy arrays.\r\n\r\nNote that participants are expected to have a good understanding of the Python language, at least some basic knowledge about NumPy and C or C++, and are able to use a C compiler on their computers to build native CPython modules from sources (e.g. install source packages from PyPI that contain C extensions). No deep C programming knowledge is required, nor is any prior knowledge needed about writing extension modules for the CPython runtime. The Cython compiler handles most of these low-level issues itself.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://cython.org/\r\n"

Q & A (10 min)\r\n\r\n**Practical part**\r\n\r\nWe try different frameworks to implement typical web tasks: handling requests, fetching data from external APIs and proxying connections. In case of reliable LAN we will use laptops of each other as services to call asynchronously. This part is interactive, everyone is a creator of own service. Then we will put some service down and do error handling, try to integrate future objects of different frameworks, run a benchmark.\r\n\r\n**Pre-requirements**\r\n\r\n- Laptop with Python 3.4+"

Even if you already know a bit about Docker, you\u2019re probably more familiar with it as a deployment tool, but in fact it offers some powerful advantages for the Python/Django developer too.\r\n\r\nThis is a hands-on workshop that also aims to clarify some key questions for the Django developer:\r\n\r\n- Why is Docker such a big deal?\r\n- What problems can Docker solve for me?\r\n- How does it work?\r\n- How can it enhance my development experience?\r\n\r\nIn the workshop we\u2019ll help install and configure Docker on your laptop (Linux/OS X/Windows), to have it working in a clear and manageable way.\r\n\r\nThen we\u2019ll step through setting up a Django project with Docker.\r\n\r\nIf we have time, we\u2019ll go on to show how Docker can help you move your project from development to deployment with minimum friction.\r\n",

Closures over just-in-time compiled functions have been used to implement function pointer like features for the atmospheric dispersion model selection.\r\n - The data analysis and reporting features have been implemented using the pandas library.\r\n - implementation.\r\n - An API is provided for scripting and interfacing from other codes.\r\nThis prototype demonstrates that the python/numba/pandas implementation leads to a much smaller and cleaner code base that the FORTRAN 77 implementation without incurring a significant performance penalty for the computationally demanding parts.

Python modules from SciPy and PyPI for the implementation of different stochastic methods (i.e.: pyEvolve, SciPy optimize) have been developed and successfully used in the Python scientific community. Based on Tsallis statistics, the PyGenSA python module has been developed for generalized simulated annealing to process complicated non-linear objective functions with a large number of local minima. Testing PyGenSA, basinhopping and differential evolution (SciPy) on many standard test functions used in optimization problems shows that PyGenSA is more reliable in general and very efficient in particular for high dimension problems."

        "Life sciences are suffering badly from a \"research reproducibility crisis\". One of possible countermeasures is automation of data acquisition and analysis. \r\n\r\nAutomated data acquisition systems facilitate standardization of conditions and measurements by minimization of human disturbance. One of such systems is IntelliCage\u2122, dedicated for long-term behavioural experiments on cohorts of mice in social context.\r\n\r\nThe robustness of data analysis may be improved with automated data analysis workflows (ADAWs): computer programs analysing the data in batch mode. Also, the source code of such program is an unequivocal, formal specification of the performed analysis. The only drawback of such approach is a significant effort and technical knowledge necessary to define an ADAW.\r\n\r\nOur goal was to simplify development of ADAWs and to shift the developer's focus from technical details (like data format) to the analysis itself. To meet the goal, we developed the PyMICE library (resource identifier: RRID:nlx_158570). The library provides an user-friendly and intuitive API to access IntelliCage data, encouraging development of ADAWs according to object-oriented and functional programming paradigms.\r\n\r\n**Acknowledgements**\r\nProject sponsored by Symfonia NCN grant: UMO-2013/08/W/NZ4/00691\r\n\r\n",

It is supported by four different programming languages, one of which is Python.\r\n\r\nSchools are central in delivering the project: the micro:bits are being distributed, through schools, to Year 7 pupils. However, the vision of the micro:bit project is that the devices are given directly to children. They are owned by the children themselves to do with as they wish.\r\n\r\nI am involved in a six-month project based in a London borough library. The project's aim is to develop support to use Python, on the micro:bit, in the context of informal learning spaces. These include extra-curricular STEM clubs, libraries, and Saturday coding clubs.\r\n\r\nMy poster will be a reportage of the project.

I will also consider some wider issues, such as the role of gender, in the roll-out of the micro:bit."

Once you learn these Python API, you can generate 3D model by Python  and 3D print those generated model.\r\n\r\n- In this session,  I will introduce Python API of some softwares and share some basic knowledges and tips when you use these API. I will also introduce my past projects with those APIs and my products.\r\n\r\n![][1]\r\n\r\n### Goal\r\n- Introduce 3D model generation and 3D printing with Python to audience\r\n\r\n### After this session, you will\r\n- Acquire the basic knowledge of 3D data structure\r\n- Understand basic concepts of Python API provided by 3D softwares\r\n- Acquire knowledge to start your 3D model generation project by Python\r\n- Know past 3D model generation projects by Python\r\n\r\n### Prerequisite\r\n- Basic knowledge of Python\r\n- Interests for 3D modeling and 3D printing by Python\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://takuro.ws/img/euro_python.jpg\r\n"

        "Technologies that allow for privacy in the communications, allowing the escape from the pervasive massive surveillance, have been there for some years now, but yet its use by the general public is far from widespread. The challenge, in our view, can be defined by one of making usable crypto. Usable for the end user, usable for the sysadmin and for the fellow application developer. In the quest for massive adoption of encryption technologies, we've been forging several python packages to solve different problems, always standing in the shoulders of giants. \r\nWe bring some tales from the trenches to share, from our humble experience trying to deploy clients and servers to provide Secured Encrypted Internet Tunnels and Encrypted Email. This includes interesting challenges dealing with key management, automatic and secure software updates, and processing of email while using stock cloud providers, while still being resistant to hostile environments.\r\nWe'll show a webmail email user agent based on this architecture, a promising future for decentralization and privacy.\r\nWe'll also talk about how to store locally encrypted data, and will present Soledad (Synchronization of Locally Encrypted Data Across Devices). Soledad is a library with server and client components that allows the development of different applications based on client-side, end-to-end and cloud-syncable encryption of private data. We'll play with some toy apps to showcase its features and potential."

Programmers can spend 5-6 hours per week on code review, but doing that is almost ignored as a skill, and instead it is often treated as a rote chore.\r\n\r\nHow many of us have seen poor reviews - those which upset people, don't catch bugs or block important features being merged? This talk explores the social and technical impacts of various code review practices as well as helpful tooling. The goal is to provide a structure to help improve how teams review code, and to introduce the costs and benefits of code review to anyone unfamiliar with the practice.\r\n\r\nThere are always trade-offs to be made - e.g. think how costly a security flaw in this code could be to your organisation - perhaps intense scrutiny is not necessary for prototypes soon to be thrown away. It is useful to consider the  trade-offs in order to optimise for a particular problem domain. Perhaps right now it is more important to look for issues with maintainability, functionality or performance.\r\n\r\nI talk about how some fantastic code reviews from mentors, colleagues and strangers have helped me become a better programmer and team member, as well as occasions where code review has been detrimental by slowing things down and causing arguments.\r\n\r\nThis is aimed at everyone from beginner to advanced programmers."

        "Microservices is the popular term for the trend to build backend\r\narchitectures as a number of smaller independent processes.

HTTP is a protocol using a strict request-response format,\r\nthis can become a little burdensome when needing to deal with\r\nasynchronous requests and forces some architectural descisions to be\r\nnot as ideal as they could be.  ZeroMQ has more flexible communication\r\npatterns allowing for easier mapping of real-life interactions between\r\nservices.  Coupled with an easy to use asynchronous user-level API and\r\nvery fast underlying communication on persistent TCP connections\r\nZeroMQ is a rather attractive transport to build your microservices\r\nbased applications in.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show how to use ZeroMQ within Python to build your\r\nmicroservices.  It will show the benefits of ZeroMQ's asynchronous\r\nAPI, common usage patterns and how to handle backpressure.\r\nFurthermore different communication patterns will be explored and the\r\nimpact this has on how to simplify the overall architecture using\r\nthese patterns."

Swagger generates an [interactive UI][4] for selecting options and easily testing queries. Flask and Flask-Restplus provide just enough syntactic sugar to make your code readable, scalable and easy to maintain.\r\n\r\nMy presentation will give an overview of the features of Flask and Flask-Restplus; I will describe how easy it is to get started and discuss some best practices for building complex APIs using this approach.

        "I will introduce CFFI, a way to call C libraries from Python.\r\n\r\n    http://cffi.readthedocs.org/\r\n\r\nCFFI was designed in 2012 to get away from Python's C extension modules,\r\nwhich require hand-written CPython-specific C code.  CFFI is arguably\r\nsimpler to use: you call C from Python directly, instead of going\r\nthrough an intermediate layer.  It is not tied to CPython's internals,\r\nand works natively on two different Python implementations: CPython and\r\nPyPy.  It could be ported to more implementations.\r\n\r\nIt is also a big success, according to the download statistics.  Some\r\nhigh-visibility projects like Cryptography have switched to it.\r\n\r\nPart of the motivation for developing CFFI is that it is a minimal layer\r\nthat allows direct access to C from Python, with no fixed intermediate C\r\nAPI.  It shares ideas from Cython, ctypes, and LuaJIT's ffi, but the\r\nnon-dependence on any fixed C API is a central point. \r\n\r\nIt is a possible solution to a problem that hits notably PyPy --- the CPython C API.  The CPython C API was great and, we can argue, it contributed a lot to\r\nthe present-day success of Python, together with tools built on top of\r\nit like Cython and SWIG.  However, it may be time to look\r\nbeyond it.  This talk will thus present CFFI as such an example.\r\nThis independence is what lets CFFI work equally well on CPython and\r\non PyPy (and be very fast on the latter thanks to the JIT compiler).\r\n"

        "[CloudABI](https://nuxi.nl/) is a new POSIX based computing environment that brings [capability-based security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security) to BSD, Linux, OSX et al.\r\n\r\nUnlike traditional Unix, if a CloudABI process goes rogue it _cannot_ execute random binaries, or read arbitrary files. This is achieved by removing `open()` & any other API able to acquire global resources. Instead a CloudABI process must be granted _capabilities_ to specific resources (e.g. directories, files, sockets) in the form of file descriptors. If a process only has a descriptor for `/var/www` then it's _incapable_ of affecting any file or folder outside that directory.\r\n\r\nThis talk will\r\n\r\n - Review the security & reusability problems of Linux & Unix processes\r\n - Introduce capability-based security\r\n - Summarize the design of CloudABI - its benefits & trade-offs\r\n - Demonstrate how to write Python software for CloudABI & run it\r\n - Point out the pitfalls & gotchas to be aware of\r\n - Discuss the current & future status of CloudABI\r\n \r\nCloudABI began life on FreeBSD. It also runs DragonFly BSD, NetBSD, PC-BSD, Arch Linux, Debian, Ubuntu, & OS X. The API & ABI are kernel agnostic - a CloudABI binary can run on any supported kernel. The design is evolved from [Capsicum](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/), a library that allows processes to drop access to undesired syscalls at runtime. CloudABI applies this at build time to make testing & lock-down easier.",

I'll share the lessons we learned and present the tools we built to reach our goal. I\u2019ll be covering topics like:\r\n - Using a PyPI proxy to both build platform-specific wheels, on order to both to withstand PyPI downtimes and cut on deployment times;\r\n - Dynamic traffic re-routing for zero-downtime deployments and horizontal scaling;\r\n - Massive TLS termination on a custom built Twisted/PyPy reverse proxy;\r\n - Live server and datacenter migrations for both apps and their data."

This platform implements specialized agents:\r\n\r\n- **Feeder** is an agent which receives real-time data from the broker.\r\n- **Router** is an agent which receives data from feeders. It manages the historical data and distributes updates to all the subscribed agents in the network.\r\n- **Brain** is the most common agent. It receives data from router or from other brains and processes them, sending the results to other brains or sending orders to be executed. Brains can make use of many useful packages avilable in the Python ecosystem: NumPy, SciPy, Numba, Theano...\r\n- **Trader** is an agent which is designed to interact with the broker, just as the feeder, but to execute market orders.\r\n\r\n![system](http://i.imgur.com/A9vsWee.png)\r\n\r\nWhile it is still in its earliest stages, we are developing a tool for real-time visualization of trading strategies using PyQtGraph.

        "This talk is about the concept of dynamic class generation in python. The whole idea is writing code that generates classes and their functionality at runtime. You now may be asking yourself, \u201cThat sounds like a neat trick. Why would I ever generate my classes at runtime?\u201d Here are a few reasons why:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIt can decrease the physical size of your code.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIt can improve the workflow in adding new functionality.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tIt can improve reliability of your code.\r\n\r\nOne example where the power of this concept has really been leveraged is in boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. Dynamic class generation has allowed boto3 to become heavily data driven such that most of its classes and methods are generated based off JSON models representing aspects of an AWS service\u2019s API. For example, to add support for a new AWS service API in boto3, just plop in a JSON file into the library with no additional Python code required.\r\n\r\nUsing lessons and techniques drawn from developing boto3, this talk will dive into the following topics related to dynamic class generation:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe basics of dynamic class generation such as how to effectively dynamically generate classes.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tHow to overcome some of the challenges of dynamic class generation.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tThe tradeoffs in dynamically generating classes and discussion on when it is appropriate.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk, the hope is that you will have a better understanding of dynamic class generation and come away with helpful ideas for your next big project."

Are you starting to get curious about those `.pyc` files that always pop up in your project, and you always ignore? Would you like to start investigating your Python code's performance, and learn why some programs you write run faster than others, even if the code looks more or less the same? Have you simply fallen so completely in love with Python that you're ready to peer deep inside its soul?\r\n\r\nIf you, like me, answered \"yes\" to any of these questions, join me in an illuminating adventure into the world of Python bytecode! Bytecode is the \"intermediate language\" that expresses your Python source code as machine instructions the interpreter (specifically CPython, the \"standard\" interpreter) can understand. Together we'll investigate what that means, and what role bytecode plays in the execution of a Python program. We'll discover how we simple humans can read this machine language using the `dis` module, and inspect the bytecode for some simple programs. We'll learn the meaning of a few instructions that often appear in our bytecode, and we'll find out how to learn the rest. Finally, we'll use bytecode to understand why a piece of Python code runs faster if we put it inside of a function.\r\n\r\nWhen you go home, you'll be able to use bytecode to get a deeper understanding of your Python code and its performance. The adventure simply starts here; where it ends is up to you!\r\n\r\n"

        "Python has recently seen a fresh development boost around asynchronous applications, triggered by the addition of the asyncio library and the new async/await language features in Python 3.5, but coming from a world of well established tools like [Twisted][2] and [Tornado][3]. The [Cython][1] compiler, which compiles Python code to C, has accompanied and influenced this development. It provides full language support for async/await under all Python versions starting from 2.6, as well as native interoperability with existing Python code and the new Python coroutines in Python 3.5.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks show that, while fully compatible, Cython compiled coroutines perform about 2-3x better than the same code executed in Python, but they additionally allow to interface natively with external C/C++ code, release the GIL, do parallel computation, and much more. All of this extends the applicable zone for asynchronous applications dramatically and can lead to better responsiveness and lower latency also for mostly I/O bound applications.\r\n\r\nThis joined talk by an async I/O expert and one of the Cython core developers explains how to write code with async/await in Python and Cython, and shows how to benefit from the excellent low-level features that Cython provides on top of Python.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://cython.org/\r\n  [2]: https://twistedmatrix.com/\r\n  [3]: http://www.tornadoweb.org/\r\n"

        "(Almost) everything in Python is mutable which makes Python a language very difficult to optimize. Most optimizations rely on assumptions, for example that builtin functions are not replaced. Optimizing Python requires a trigger to disable optimization when an assumption is no more true. FAT Python exactly does that with guards checked at runtime. For example, an optimization relying on the builtin len() function is disabled when the function is replaced.\r\n\r\nGuards allows to implement various optimizations. Examples: loop unrolling (duplicate the loop body), constant folding (propagates constants), copy builtins to constants, remove unused local variables, etc.\r\n\r\nFAT Python implements guards and an optimizer rewriting the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). The optimizer is implemented in Python so it's easy to enhance it and implement new optimizations.\r\n\r\nFAT Python uses a static optimizer, it is less powerful than a JIT compiler like PyPy with tracing, but it was written to be integrated into CPython.\r\n\r\nI wrote 3 PEP (509, 510, 511) targeting Python 3.6. Some changes to support FAT Python have already been merged into Python 3.6.\r\n\r\nWe will also see other pending patches to optimize CPython core, and the bytecode project which allows to modify bytecode, it also includes a peephole optimizer written in pure Python.\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n\r\n*  http://faster-cpython.readthedocs.org/fat_python.html\r\n* http://fatoptimizer.readthedocs.org/\r\n* http://bytecode.readthedocs.org/",

        "TFTP was first standardized in '81 (same year I was born!) and one of its primary uses is in the early stage of network booting. TFTP is very simple to implement, and one of the reasons it is still in use is that its small footprint allows engineers to fit the code into very low resource, single board computers, system-on-a-chip implementations and mainboard chipsets, in the case of modern hardware.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore a crucial protocol deployed in almost every data center environment. It is used, together with DHCP, to chain load Network Boot Programs (NBPs),  like Grub2 and iPXE. They allow machines to bootstrap themselves and install operating systems off of the network, downloading kernels and initrds via HTTP and starting them up.\r\n\r\nAt Facebook, we have been using the standard in.tftpd daemon for years, however, we started to reach its limitations.\r\nLimitations that were partially due to our scale and the way TFTP was deployed in our infrastructure, but also to the protocol specifications based on requirements from the 80's.\r\n\r\nTo address those limitations we ended up writing our own framework for creating dynamic TFTP servers in Python3, and we decided to open source it.\r\n\r\nI will take you thru the framework and the features it offers. I'll discuss the specific problems that motivated us to create it. We will look at practical examples of how touse it, along with a little code, to build your own server that are tailored to your own infra needs.",

They are cheap to gather (just increment a number!) but setting up a metrics system to collect and store them is a major task.\r\n\r\nYou may have heard of statsd, Riemann, Graphite, InfluxDB, or OpenTSB.  They all look promising but on a closer look it\u2019s apparent that some of those solutions are straight-out flawed and others are hard to integrate with each other or even to get up and running.\r\n\r\nThen came Prometheus and gave us independence of UDP, no complex math in your application, multi-dimensional data by adding labels to values (no more server names in your metric names!), baked in monitoring capabilities, integration with many common systems, and official clients for all major programming languages.  In short: a *unified* way to gather, process, and present metrics.\r\n\r\nThis talk will:\r\n\r\n1. explain why you want to collect metrics,\r\n1. give an overview of the problems with existing solutions,\r\n1. try to convince you that Prometheus may be what you\u2019ve been waiting for,\r\n1. teach how to impress your co-workers with beautiful graphs and intelligent monitoring by putting a fully instrumented Python application into production,\r\n1. and finally give you pointers on how to migrate an existing metrics infrastructure to Prometheus *or* how to integrate Prometheus therein.\r\n",

      "abstract_extra": "# Notes\r\n\r\nLast year I spoke about metrics and logging in general.  People approached me afterwards expressing interest in metrics but felt lost.  And truth to be told, back then the metrics landscape was not very good.\r\n\r\nThe rise of [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io) with decent Python integration changed that considerably.  It\u2019s possible to have one coherent metrics platform for both system and app metrics (in various programming languages) and even get monitoring for free.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as a follow-up, I want to do this kind-of case study on how I\u2019ve harmonized our metrics.  The talk will **not** build on the older one though.\r\n\r\nThe key idea is to start from nothing and ending up with a well-instrumented system including monitoring.  I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s ever been a comparable talk.\r\n\r\n# Technical Aptitude\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve implemented most of [Variomedia](http://www.variomedia.de)\u2019s metrics infrastructure using Graphite and later moved it to Prometheus.  Therefore I know both sides of the coin.  I\u2019m also working on the [asyncio/Twisted integration](https://github.com/hynek/prometheus_async/) for the Prometheus Python client.\r\n\r\nIn general OSS terms, I\u2019m a PSF fellow, a dormant CPython core dev, an active Twisted core dev, help out in way too many projects, and have a fair share of [own projects](https://github.com/hynek/) too.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Speaking Experience\r\n\r\nThis talk has been [accepted](https://us.pycon.org/2016/schedule/presentation/1601/) to PyCon US.  People already [expressed their hopes](https://twitter.com/d0ugal/status/695678965529374720) that I submit it to EP too.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I\u2019ve spoken at the past three PyCon US ([deployments](https://hynek.me/talks/python-deployments/), [TLS](https://hynek.me/talks/tls/), and [Loggging/Metrics](https://hynek.me/talks/beyond-grep/)), the past three EuroPythons (same), PyCon Russia 2014 (TLS, invited speaker), PyCon PL 2014 (TLS, invited speaker), PiterPy 2015 (Logging/Metrics, invited speaker), PyCon JP 2015 (Logging/Metrics, keynote).  From what I gather from the feedback and buzz, I think it\u2019s fair to say that my talks have been well-received so far.  Especially because I try to make them both informative *and* entertaining at once.\r\n\r\nI put a *lot* of effort into my talks: I start at least three months prior to the conference and work, polish, and practice until EP.  Therefore I\u2019m hopeful to deliver another popular talk.  Of course, there will be a accompanying page again like in the previous years.\r\n\r\n# Preliminary Outline\r\n\r\n1. Prometheus\r\n\t- short history\r\n\t- philosophy\r\n\t\t- push vs. pull\r\n\t\t- simplest math in-app\r\n\t- why no statsd/Graphite?\r\n\t\t- UDP\r\n\t\t\t- more load = more packets\r\n\t\t\t- lots of load = lost packets\r\n\t\t- one-dimensional data (e.g. `app.server1.process5.request_time` instead of `app.request_time` with tags/labels with metadata)\r\n\t- presentation of result: beautiful dashboard & working monitoring\r\n1. System Metrics\r\n\t- `node_exporter` for native system metrics\r\n\t- examples of other popular exporters like nginx\r\n\t- `collectd_exporter` and `graphite_exporter` as bridges while transitioning\r\n1. Instrumenting Your App [*concrete* examples]\r\n\t- general considerations\r\n\t\t- what to measure\r\n\t\t- how to avoid code duplication\r\n\t\t- protecting your exposed metrics\r\n\t- example: long-running web app (simple pyramid or flask app with DB & caching)\r\n\t- example: batch job (e.g. a backup)\r\n\t- example: asyncio (simple echo server or something similar)\r\n\t- example: Twisted (same)\r\n\t- opaque cloud environments\r\n\t\t- how does heroku fit in?\r\n1. Visualisation\r\n\t- building queries in the integrated graph browser\r\n\t- Grafana\r\n\t\t- building beautiful and useful dashboards\r\n\t\t- correlating system metrics with app metrics\r\n1. Monitoring\r\n\t- defining alerts\r\n\t- integration with 3rd parties (e.g. PagerDuty, nagios)\r\n1. Next Steps\r\n\t- how to fully automate metrics endpoint discovery (e.g. consul)\r\n\t- long term metrics storage",

        "If you have ever happened to need to deal with GPS data in Python you may have felt a bit lost. There are many libraries at various states of maturity and scope. Finding a place to start and to actually work with the GPS data might not be as easy and obvious as you might expect from other Python domains. \r\nInspired from my own experiences of dealing with GPS data in Python, I want to give an overview of some useful libraries. From basic reading and writing GPS tracks in the GPS Exchange Format with the help of gpxpy to adding missing elevation information with srtm.py. Additionally, I will cover mapping and visualising tracks on OpenStreetmap with mplleaflet that even supports interactive plots in a Jupyter notebook.\r\nBesides the tooling, I will also demonstrate and explain common algorithms like Douglas-Peucker to simplify a track and the famous Kalman filters for smoothing. For both algorithms I will give an intuition about how they work as well as their basic mathematical concepts. Especially the Kalman filter that is used for all kinds of sensor, not only GPS, has the reputation of being hard to understand. Still, its concept is really easy and quite comprehensible as I will also demonstrate by presenting an implementation in Python with the help of Numpy and Scipy. My presentation will make heavy use of the Jupyter notebook which is a wonderful tool perfectly suited for experimenting and learning.\r\n",

        "A decline in size and weight of Atlantic herring  in the Celtic Sea has been observed since the mid-1980\u2019s.  The cause of the decline remains largely unexplained but is likely to be driven by the interactive effect of various endogenous and exogenous factors. The goal of this study is to interrogate a long time-series of biological data obtained from commercial fisheries from 1959 to 2012.  We use gradient boosting regression trees to identify important variables underlying changes in growth from various potential drivers, such as: \r\n- Atlantic multidecadal oscillation;\r\n- sea surface temperature;\r\n- salinity;\r\n- wind;\r\n- zooplankton abundance;\r\n- fishing pressure.\r\nThis learning algorithm allows to quantify the influence of the potential drivers of change with the test error lower when compared to other supervised learning techniques. The predictor variables importance spectrum (feature importance) helps to identify the underlying patterns and potential tipping points while resolving the external mechanisms underlying observed changes in size and weight of herring.  This analysis is a useful case-study of how Python can be implemented in academia.  The outputs of the analysis are of relevance to conservation efforts and sustainable fisheries management which promotes species resistance and resilience."

Questions from\r\nthe audience are expected and welcome.\r\nThe talk is of interest to a large public, since it is mostly about\r\nmeasuring things, monitoring and testing a legacy system,\r\nmaking sure that the changes do not break the previous behavior\r\nand keeping the users happy, while internally rewriting\r\nall of the original code.

To facilitate this, we have developed EFL (Embedded Flexible Language), a deterministic parallel programming tool. \r\nThe parallel parts of a program are written as EFL-blocks, which are embedded into a sequential host language program. The sequential parts of the program are written in the host language, outside the EFL blocks.   \r\nEFL may be embedded in any host language by writing an appropriate EFL pre-compiler. At the moment, we implemented two versions of the EFL pre-compiler. Both pre-compilers translate EFL blocks into parallel Python code - one of them generates parallel code based on Python's Multiprocessing module, and the other one generates parallel code based on the DTM/MPI4PY Python module.\r\nWe will present the principles upon which EFL is built. We will show the implementation of Parallel Programming Design Patterns using EFL's parallel programming constructs (such as parallel assignments, parallel for-loops, etc.).  Using our two EFL pre-compilers we will show their translation to Python parallel code according to the Multiprocessing module as well as the DTM/MPI4PY module. The differences between code versions produced by the EFL pre-compilers will be discussed. \r\nFor further information about the EFL project and our Flexible Computation Research Laboratory, visit http://flexcomp.jct.ac.il\r\n",

        "Continuous Delivery, DevOps, Lean - all those movements have one thing in common: extending the process of software development along the whole value stream, ultimately to the customer. This simple requirement causes surprising serious difficulties on traditional operations workflows. All of a sudden, a single manual ticket to the operations team is a critical blocker in the delivery process. Therefore all parts of the infrastructure, storage, databases, identities, compute resources must be provided as a self service for the developers in order to be able to achieve this goal. What one may call \"the cloud\" (including self hosted ones like open stack) is such a successful model not least because they offer exactly this \"ticket-less\" self-service. But why should we wait for \"the cloud\" to offer what we really need? We are python developers, we are hackers!\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will show how to build your own infrastructure-as-a-service on the example of \"Postgraas\", an open source postgres-as-a-service I wrote in python just for fun. With a simple curl request you can get your very own database, just like RDS on AWS. You will learn how easy it is to create such a remarkably useful service with hardly three hundred lines of flask, docker and some glue-code, a project for a rainy Sunday. After the talk you will know how to amaze your colleagues by eliminating an annoying ticket or manual workflow with a simple flask app and some creativity.",

Shaolin is a new python project that aims to provide a framework for building interactive complex dashboards.\r\n\r\nShaolin provides all the basic tools for building complex interactive data analysis applications using the pydata ecosystem. Arbitrary code can be embedded into a Dashboard -a class that works as a \u201cblack box\u201d that allows to easily define a GUI based on the ipywidgets package- to process any data in any form and then let you interactively define how to plot it using automatically generated widgets. Hierarchical combinations of Dashboards can be arranged then to build more complex applications.\r\n\r\nThe talk is divided in two sections. First one introduce the framework and its main features:\r\n\r\n - Custom syntax for defining widgets in a simplified way.\r\n - Dashboards: Syntax rules and capabilities.\r\n - Combining Dashboards to build complex applications.\r\n - Interactive plot creation.\r\n - Integration with pydata.\r\n\r\nSecond section will show how this framework can be used to analyse real data using Dashboards without writing any code. I will show how to transform market data time series into graphs using pandas and networkx, then plot it interactively using bokeh and Vpython.\r\n\r\n"

Everything there is online works, but I'm still testing like half of the Dashboards I have programmed, before uploading them. Expect thie beta version to be  finished by the date of the talk.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are no recordings of the talks I have already given, but you can find some info about the R&D work we are doing at HCSoft in this blog http://entropicai.blogspot.com.es/",

How do I know it \"when I see it\"? From previous experience of course! We will provide human labeled examples of spam to our model for it to understand the likelihood of spam or ham. This approach, using examples and data we already know to determine the most likely label for a new example, uses the Naive Bayes classifier.\r\n\r\nOur model will look at the words in the body of an email, finding the frequency of words in both spam and ham emails and the frequency of spam and ham. Once we know the prior likelihood of spam and what makes something spam, we can try applying a label to a new example.\r\n\r\nThrough this exercise we will see at a basic level what types of questions machine learning asks, learn to model \"learning\" with Python, and understand how learning can be measured."

The learning curve was steep when reading this white paper, it was heavy on math and jargon for those that are not from the machine learning world. In fact I am a policy analyst who turned programmer just over two years ago (at the time of PyCon 2016). Most of my learning is self-taught or self-guided thus I find it important to be curious and use that curiosity to provide content in accessible formats to all.\r\n\r\nThis talk is not meant to be an exhaustive understanding of Naive Bayes but a focused talk on what machine learning questions look like and how Python can answer it.\r\n\r\nPast speaking experience:\r\n\r\nI performed this talk at PyOhio 2015 (http://www.pyvideo.org/video/3690/is-that-spam-in-my-ham-a-novices-inquiry-into-c) and received a good amount of feedback as well as additional questions to help me better direct the talk. \r\n\r\nI've taught quite a bit with the Girl Develop It Chicago chapter and as an original (and current) co-organizer and co-founder of PyLadies Chicago I've taught several of our workshops. For a listing of the workshops I've taught and the talks I've given can be found at - http://lorenamesa.com/pages/speaking.html. \r\n\r\nI spoke at PyTennessee in Feb 2016 on a similar beginner data collection and modeling exercise with some basic machine learning analysis. The talk had  amazing feedback and I am now building out smaller workshops around it. I find that many beginner programmers have an overwhelming fear of trying to take on such topics and think that this would be a great talk for beginners to start learning.\r\n",

We will also be talking about what we are going to do next, moving our system from near real time monitoring to near real-time control, using Python for both system modelling and control.

Illustrating it with numerous examples, attendees will leave having assimilated at least several concepts that will improve their code undeniably and irremediably. Emphasis will be on showing specific cases where a traditional solution can be overhauled over and over with functions from the itertools module.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s say, for example, that we want to alternate indefinitely between two values: -1 and 1. The novice would use a variable, updating its value at each step, and the average user would maybe opt for an endless generator. Both are worthy and honorable solutions, but they pale before the mastery of the martial artist who only needs itertools.cycle(). Because that is the nature of the itertools module: once the veil falls from our eyes and we come across functions such as repeat(), takewhile(), dropwhile() or product(), there is no return. In this talk we will learn to identify when they can be used, accomplishing with a single line of code what for the mere mortals takes much more effort."

Following the old proverb \"An API is only as good as its documentation\", we decided to play with these ideas and focus on leveraging the power of documentation. We propose to use the code documentation and the type system to provide: \r\n - browsable APIs, that are easy to interact with and visualize, reducing the need to provide custom UIs \r\n -  verification of inputs/outputs along with precise error message if needed \r\n - automatic [de]-serialization of inputs/ouputs outside of the domain code\r\n - smart exception handling, e.g. exceptions that are not documented are automatically converted into internal errors\r\n - automatic testing, e.g. input, output and result including exceptions are tested ensuring the code works and the documentation is up-to-date.   \r\n\r\n\r\nThis use case is one of the rare situation where introspection is desirable and unavoidable. And Python is a good language to explore/exploit code and documentation dynamically. The perfect excuse to spend some time on meta coding a first implementation while being at work. We'll demonstrate what we came up to, the advantages and limitations compared to other approaches. And we'll share the lessons we learned from this experiment.\r\n\r\n"

        "It is relatively easy to build a first-cut machine learning model. But what does it take to build a reasonably good model, or even a state-of-art model ?\r\n\r\nEnsemble models. They are our best friends. They help us exploit the power of computing. Ensemble methods aren't new. They form the basis for some extremely powerful machine learning algorithms like random forests and gradient boosting machines. The key point about ensemble is that consensus from diverse models are more reliable than a single source. This talk will cover how we can combine model outputs from various base models(logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, neural networks, etc) to create a stronger/better model output.\r\n\r\nThis talk will cover various strategies to create ensemble models.\r\n\r\nUsing third-party Python libraries along with scikit-learn, this talk will demonstrate the following ensemble methodologies:\r\n1) Bagging\r\n2) Boosting\r\n3) Stacking\r\n\r\nReal-life examples from the enterprise world will be show-cased where ensemble models produced better results consistently when compared against single best-performing models.\r\n\r\nThere will also be emphasis on the following: Feature engineering, model selection, importance of bias-variance and generalization.\r\n\r\nCreating better models is the critical component of building a good data science product. \r\n\r\nA preliminary version of the slides is available [here](https://speakerdeck.com/bargava/power-of-ensembles)",

        "In recent years, we've seen interesting and spectacular successes in artificial intelligence and machine learning, made possible by leaps in computing power and techniques able to harvest vast quantities of data.\r\n\r\nThe results are uncanny. We see them everywhere, from the personal assistants built into smartphones to the neural networks that do an astounding job of recognising images. However, they're also susceptible to the criticism that they represent not intelligence but a mere simulation of it, and that producing a convincing simulacrum has become more important than a genuine search for  intelligence or learning.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, another, perhaps deeper, approach has become neglected in recent decades, along with the questions it asks about the nature of mind, intelligence and learning. This approach begins with fundamental questions in logic and language, and can be explored using some of the simplest programming techniques.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I'll use simple Python programs to explore three key notions in this strand of artificial intelligence research: *loops*, *self-reference* and *tangled hierarchies*. The way these concepts directly reflect important concepts in programming suggests that for the programmer, this approach could be more interesting and satisfying, and simply more **fun,** than using huge ontologies and big data to create mere simulacra of intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe examples I use will be concrete and easy to understand, even for novice programmers."

But the functionality to visualize networks is not very strong and not to mention the missing interactive manipulation. However during the exploration of data: exporting, feeding an extra tool for visualization and then manipulating data manually was a tedious workflow.\r\n\r\nAs I also had the optional target of presenting networks in a browser, I improved this workflow by creating a Flask web application providing interfaces to my networks. On the browser side I created a javascript client based on D3.js. In retrospective the required programming effort in Python and also in Javascript was too much for such a task. And exactly this target, interactive visualization in a browser (and as bonus in a Jupyter Notebook), can be achieved quiet easy now with Bokeh.\r\n\r\nThe talk will be a step by step introduction, starting with the basic visualization of a network using Bokeh, NetworkX and a Jupyter Notebook. Next, how to create interactions with your network which will be used to change a network structure, e.g. a leaving person. As we want to see directly the impact of these changes in a network I will finally show how to update networks and visualize directly how the importance of the remaining people changes.

Since the server has no insight into the nature of the data, the risk of data being exposed via a server-side data breach is eliminated. Even if the server is successfully infiltrated, adversaries would not have access to the cleartext data and cannot derive anything useful out of disk or RAM snapshots. \r\n\r\nZeroDB provides end-to-end encryption while maintaining much of the functionality expected of a modern database, such as full-text search, sort, and range queries. Additionally, ZeroDB uses proxy re-encryption and/or delta key technology to enable secure, granular sharing of encrypted data without exposing keys to the server and without sharing the same encryption key between users of the database.\r\n\r\nZeroDB can be used by enterprises to securely outsource on-premise database and storage infrastructure to cloud environments. Enterprises can encrypt client-side and keep keys on-premise, so that they're only pushing encrypted data to the cloud.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, developers can easily write end-to-end encrypted applications with strong security and privacy guarantees."

The Cython optimization shown in talk is a real optimization performed recently to make the debugger faster and was our collaborative effort.\r\nThe profiler introduced in the talk: Vmprof.\r\nI am not a direct committer to the project, but I have collaborated with the PyPy team for the last half of a year on making it available on Windows and Mac OSX. I am quite aware of the tool usage limitations as well as it's implementation details.\r\n\r\n*Audience*\r\nThe talk is supposed to be also intelligible for novice developers as they can get out of it some general concepts about profiling and optimization. While developers with intermediate experience will know about implementation details and learn some best practices.\r\n\r\n*Slides*\r\nWhile the main example in the talk will be a real Python debugger, I will avoid showing the real code on my slides. Instead there will be simplified snippets that are able to express the main idea of the optimization needed to perform and the resulting outcome. I tried this approach in my past talk 'Python Debugger Uncovered' and it proved to be a good approach.\r\nThe real project will be visible only during profiling phase in the form of visual call tree and probably other diagrams.\r\n\r\n*Past speaking experience*\r\nI gave a 30 minutes talk called \"Python Debugger Uncovered\" about implementation details of Python debugger at Europython 2014 in Berlin and at PyCon APAC 2015 in Taipei.

        "The inevitability of failures is the bane of scaling any modern web service and can cause serious pain for end users! Lucky for us, there are techniques that can help protect your product handle failures in subsystems gracefully. This talk will dive into one of these in depth, the Circuit Breaker pattern, and explore the options it gives us for keeping our users safe.\r\n\r\nWe will be focusing on several real-world problems and how they can be addressed by circuit breakers. You should expect to leave the talk with details on simple circuit breakers as well as understanding how they can be adapted for more complex situations. We\u2019ll also discuss some options for how to implement your circuit breaker in readable python.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Contrived FAQ time!**\r\n\r\n**I don\u2019t know what Circuit Breakers are, should I come?**\r\nDefinitely! We\u2019re going to start from scratch and work our way up. Only requirement is basic familiarity with backend services receiving and making HTTP requests.\r\n\r\n**I totally know what Circuit Breakers are, should I come?**\r\nDefinitely! After the intro, the main meat of the talk will be working through a series of more advanced situations and talking about how we can alter the basic circuit breaker setup to address them. \r\n\r\n**I want real-world advice, not made up hypotheticals!**\r\nWell that\u2019s not really a question, but you\u2019ll be happy to know that the examples we\u2019ll discuss come straight from my experience at Yelp. They should be very realistic and broadly applicable.\r\n\r\n",

But it is just a library: each program needs to import and set up the libraries, implement a game loop and load resources among numerous other concerns. While seasoned Pythonistas have no trouble with this, teachers told us that they found it difficult to teach with Pygame. There is simply too much boilerplate involved, and getting students to reproduce the boilerplate perfectly before useful lessons can begin takes too much time out of a 40-minute lesson.\r\n\r\nPygame Zero is simple enough that a lesson can be broken down into bitesize steps where meaningful progress can be made with just a couple of lines of code at a time."

Backwards-incompatible changes will be addressed and changes made to the documentation will be highlighted.\r\n\r\nIf you are already familiar with pytest, you will be happy to hear about significant improvements of the fixture and hook system but also what's in store for a better integration with tox, an important tool that allows testing across different Python versions.\r\n\r\nIn June, 2016 more than 25 Pythonistas from around the globe gather in Freiburg, Germany to work on the release and set the path for future developments of the core framework. This is a big step forward for the project made posssible by a fundraiser that reached 108% of it's initial goal.\r\n\r\nI will share our experiences from the developer sprint while they are still fresh and explain why these events are incredibly important for a community and give advice on how to organize your own."

The data format was primitive structures -- hard to read and easy to break. Field order and all the data had to be entered manually.\r\n\r\nAt the time, I have already seen the better world --  the models from Django. Have you ever wondered how those work? Step by step, I used the ideas from there to make the structures more friendly and on my way I rediscovered descriptors.\r\n\r\nI'll show in incremental steps, how:\r\n\r\n - used keyword arguments to lower signal to noise ratio,\r\n - order of definition for sorting the fields,\r\n - realized that `__call__` is used instead of assignment,\r\n - used `__setattribute__` as first step to extend primitive fields,\r\n - discovered that I'm actually reimplementing descriptors,\r\n\r\nand how it lead me to:\r\n \r\n  - implement printing in a way that is friendly to regression testing,\r\n  - use diff library for less code and better results,\r\n  - implement more readable validation.\r\n\r\nI want to show how descriptors work in Python and how they enable declarative style of programming. By the end of the talk I want you to understand what is at the core of the magic behind field types used by object relational mappers like Django.\r\n\r\n"

        "For ages people have been watching the sky, and tried to learn something about all those mysterious lights. In ancient times, scientist used mostly their naked eyes to watch what happened in the night sky. Astronomy is one of the oldest fields in science. \r\nEverything changed when Galileo invented his lunette. Thanks to thi, we were able to proof Copernicus\u2019 new model of the solar system with the sun in the center. \r\n\r\nThe next big step in Astronomy was using computers. Where there are computers and Astronomy, there is a place for programming. For many years astronomers were mostly using Fortran and C/C++. Both are suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Since they are structured programming language, that makes them very valuable for science.\r\n\r\nOver the past decade, Python has started to be used by more and more people in astronomy. But is there a place in Astronomy for Python, as it is not as fast as Fortran or C/C++? In Python there is a module called AstroPy which helps astronomers in their work. \r\n\r\nMatPlotLib is one of the most popular library use in astronomy. This tool helps created very sophisticated plots and graphs.\r\n\r\nFinally I would like talk about some research I did using Python. For research, we decided to use AUTO. It is a hybrid of Fortran and Python, to compute bifurcation points in mathematical models. In Python we introduce mathematical model, ODE and initial parameters. Fortran does all the computation.\r\n",

Most of us use virtualenvs which are reliable and comfortable to use. But there are some issues. For instance, the repeatability and immutability of the built environment are not guaranteed. \r\n\r\nVirtualenv does a lot of work that targets the direction of somehow isolated and independent environments. They are *almost* *fully* repeatable. In any team, we can hear the notorious expression \"It works for me!\".\r\n\r\nFor some time now, I am using Docker instead of virtualenv for building custom and really-virtual environments that are entirely isolated. The containers are immutable and consistent, so this workflow guarantees repeatability.  Using such technique, not only enables the user to have unique and immutable environments, it also allows de developer to create full app architecture that can then be tested and deployed as is. So the production version will be in identical conditions as the one from the development environment. These features are not provided by virtualenv at all.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this exercise is to try to use totally different tooling for building the application from its first line of code until the production.

Instead of running multiple instances of a monolithic application, with all the complexity and operational run-time overhead that entails, you can scale only the functionality which is a bottleneck. Today that increasingly means scaling out, not up.\r\n\r\nWe will go over open source technologies which allow the easy scaling out across distributed devices.\r\n\r\nA live demo will allow the audience to participate with its devices (including mobile phones) in an application. (There will be prizes for the donors.)\r\n\r\nThe demo uses [Crossbar.io,][1] an open source router for the open [Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP) ][2] written in Python. WAMP supports routed Remote Procedure Calls, and Crossbar.io uses these to implement various load-balancing strategies across endpoints which register a particular procedure.\r\n\r\nWAMP has a first-class library for Python ([Autobahn|Python][3]), but is cross-language, with support for a total of 11 languages. This allows you to implement polyglot and heterogenos microservices applications, from Python to Node.js to C# right into the browser. Microservices can run anywhere, since the outgoing connections to the router which WAMP uses avoid NAT problems.\r\n\r\nAll software used is open source, and all demo code is provided on GitHub under the MIT license.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://crossbar.io\r\n  [2]: http://wamp-proto.org\r\n  [3]: http://autobahn.ws/python",

The simplest way to do so is to call up a Web page in a browser which will connect to the application and provide a JavaScript implementation of the microservice to scale. (This also provides realtime feedback about audience participation.) We will also provide a Python client, and potentially clients in other languages for participants to run on their laptops.\r\n\r\nParticipation will be possible via conference wi-fi, a local dedicated wi-fi network or a mobile network - so problems with the conference wi-fi network (always a possibility) will not impact the demo.",

Like Processing, Python has become a favourite language of users from diverse backgrounds, such as web development, education, and science. Unlike Processing, python lacks a simple and easy to use library for drawing shapes. Python\u2019s existing libraries for scientific computing and data analysis could be made even more awesome when combined with a simple drawing library.\r\n\r\nVPython contains a module called visual that established a simple API and convention for drawing shapes, however it was written in C++, prior to the development of pyglet, and thus is not entirely cross-platform. In this talk, I will demonstrate my solution to this problem: a re-implementation of visual purely in Python called PygletHelper. Pyglet, an existing python library, provides a python interface to OpenGL. PygletHelper is built on pyglet but obscures all of the OpenGL calls, such that the user can draw simple geometric shapes to the screen and animate them without needing to know about computer graphics terminology, memory usage, or C data types.\r\n\r\nI will also show some need visualizations of science and music in my talk, as well as the graphical glitches encountered implementing the library.

As we move away from monolithic architectures, system testing becomes more important but also more complicated.\r\n\r\nIn the video game industry, if a game doesn\u2019t work properly immediately after launch, it will heavily impact game success. We have found system testing to be an important tool for pre launch testing of game services and operational tools, to guarantee quality of these services at launch.\r\n\r\nWe want to share with you best practices for system testing: when to write system tests, what to test and what not to, and common pitfalls to avoid. Using python\u2019s pytest tool and docker-py for setting up services and their dependencies has made it easier than ever to write complex but maintainable system tests and we\u2019ll share with you how we\u2019ve made use of them.\r\n\r\nDevelopers (senior and junior) and ops folks can walk away from this talk with practical tips they can use to apply system testing to their software.",

They both can be run relatively fast on a development machine and can give fast feedback to the developer, preventing many kinds of problems.\r\n\r\nService tests run the whole application process without any internal modifications, but have to present the service with a fake \"outside world\". I'll show how to fake external HTTP services with Mountebank (similar to WireMock). Instead of faking other systems (like databases) we can quickly spin up the real deal as a Docker container from within the tests.\r\n\r\nContract tests check if the contract (interface) of your service with the outside world is kept, so no external services should be broken by the changes you are introducing. It can also work the other way around, proving that your collaborators are keeping their part of the deal. In both cases, Swagger (a RESTful API description scheme) and a few clever tricks can be used for significant advantage."

Keyword-based search is effective in finding code that is explicitly designed and documented to be reused, e.g. libraries and frameworks, but typically fails to identify reusable functions and classes in the large corpus of auxiliary code of software projects.\r\n\r\nTDR aims to address the limits of keyword-based search with test-driven code search that focuses instead on code behaviour and semantics. Developing a new feature in TDR starts with the developer writing the tests that will validate candidate implementations of the desired functionality. Before writing any functional code the tests are run against all functions and classes of available projects. Any code passing the tests is presented to the developer as a candidate implementation for the target feature.\r\n\r\n[Pytest-nodev](https://github.com/nodev-io/pytest-nodev) and other nodev tools that help implement TDR for Python are newer than the JAVA counterparts, in spite of that we will present several applications of the technique to more and more complex examples."

Nowadays mindfulness serves as the core technique of several western programs ranging from  curing stress-induced medical problems to curricula for teaching successful business leadership, such as the Search Inside Yourself  (SIY) program developed at Google in 2002. \r\n\r\nMind is the root of all things. Neuroscience shows that attention is a fundamental function of the mind. Being able to direct attention to the present moment - and keep it there while performing daily tasks - is a great tool to navigate through life and its  challenges with more engagement, more happiness, and more resilience. Focusing attention in a relaxed way enables us to disconnect from the overall noise found in a high-speed environment and get things done without feeling too overwhelmed by them. But being effective is not only about checking off more tasks - it is about how we are in resonance with our environment, how we interact with others, and how we face the increasing complexity in our professional life. \r\n\r\nThe aim of this seminar is to provide a practical experience of mindfulness with a short introduction to how it can be applied in a technology driven world as experience by digital workers."

        "Email has been declared dead several times but refuses to die.  It remains the backbone of the web and remains the largest federated open social network to date. However, most people and organisations rely on a few big email operators which fund their operations through advertisements and user tracking. But is it neccessary to hand off email messaging operations to large operators? Is dealing with unsolicited email (SPAM) still too maintenance intensive to deploy it by yourself? Is handling secret keys to unlock encrypted mails still a nightmare? Are there somewhat secure email hosting solutions?\r\n\r\nIn recent years there have been renewed efforts to renovate the state of world wide email infrastructure with initiatives such as the \"Dark Mail Alliance\", \"FreedomBox\", \"Mailpile\", \"Mail-in-a-box\" and the \"LEAP encryption access project\". Some of them are using Python to provide security to users both from criminal, corporate and state level attacks and could use help from experienced python programmers.\r\n\r\nThe talk concludes with highlighting current ongoing research (Panoramix and NEXTLEAP) funded by the European Union over the next couple years. They try to ease and automate key management and provide \"encryption by default\" among other goals. After this talk you'll end up having a better understanding of how you can use existing technologies for yourself or your organisation and how you can possibly help to improve them and make life for users and activists safer world-wide.",

No es lo mismo un adorable gato que un gato mec\u00e1nico, pero por el contexto diferenciamos esta palabra polis\u00e9mica.\r\nHasta ahora la mayor parte de los modelos representan una frase como una bolsa de palabras.

        "Python is widely used in Cosmology, which is the study of the Universe and all forms of energy in it. A large amount of data has been recently obtained through space satellite missions, such as Planck, financed by ESA/NASA. Planck has observed the radiation emitted about 13 billion years ago (the Cosmic Microwave Background, CMB), which gives us information on the content and space-time geometry of the Universe. Many competitive theoretical models have been proposed that aim at describing the evolution of the species contained in the Universe: therefore, cosmologists need a method to identify which theoretical model better fits the data. In order to compare data with theoretical predictions, cosmologists use Bayesian statistics and Monte Carlo simulations. Among the tools developed for the analysis, the package \u2018Monte Python\u2019 is publicly available and uses python to perform Monte Carlo simulations: this allows to determine the theoretical model that maximizes the likelihood to obtain the observed data. Such model is now the standard cosmological model and reveals a Universe that is very different from what scientists had ever expected. A Universe in which the atoms we are made of, constitute only 5% of the total energy budget. The rest is the so-called \u2018Dark Universe\u2019.\r\n\r\nI will illustrate the story of how cosmologists used python to analyse the data of the CMB and unveil the Dark Universe.",

What is great about LLVM-IR is that you can take any language and distill it into a form that can be run on many different machines. Once the code gets into IR it doesn\u2019t matter what platform it was originally written on, and it doesn\u2019t matter that Python can be slow. It doesn\u2019t matter if you have weird CPUs - if they\u2019re supported by LLVM it will run.\r\n\r\nWhat is Tupleware?\r\n\r\nTupleWare is an analytical framework built at Brown University that allows users to compile functions into distributed programs that are automatically deployed. TupleWare is unique because it uses LLVM-IR to be language and platform independent.\r\n\r\nWhat is PyLLVM?\r\n\r\nThis is the heart of the talk. PyLLVM is a simple, easy to extend, one-pass static compiler that takes in the subset of Python most likely to be used by Tupleware. PyLLVM is based on an existing project called py2llvm that was abandoned around 2011. \r\n\r\nThis talk will go through some basic compiler design and talk about how some LLVM-IR features make our lives easier, and some much harder. It will cover types, scoping, memory management, and other implementation details. To conclude, it will compare PyLLVM to Numba, a Python-to-LLVM compiler from Continuum Analytics and touch on what the future has in store for PyLLVM.",

I\u2019ve taken the feedback I got from this presentation and incorporated it into my new talk.\r\n\r\nThere were some technical difficulties with the A/V so I had to restart a few slides in, but the talk is almost fully recorded: \r\n\r\n[**Link to PyGotham video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HdfEqSqI2M).\r\n\r\n[**Link to PyGotham slides**](https://github.com/aherlihy/PythonLLVM/blob/master/PyGotham%20Slides.pdf)\r\n\r\n[**Link to the paper that this talk is based on**](https://github.com/aherlihy/PythonLLVM/blob/master/Thesis.pdf)\r\n\r\nAnd if you\u2019re curious, the source code for the project itself is in the same repo!\r\n\r\nI also gave a much more technical version of this talk to the Brown University Computer Science department in 2014.\r\n\r\nOther Speaking Experience\r\n======================\r\nMost recently, I was invited to be a part of a panel organized by PyLadies and WriteSpeakCode called \u201cTales of Open Source: Five Contributors, Five Stories\u201d along with Ben Darnell, David Turner, Julian Berman, and Maia McCormick in October 2015 in NYC.\r\n[**Link to event page**](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-PyLadies/events/225696976)\r\n\r\nI spoke at OpenDataSciCon in Boston May 2015.

I tried to access this site just now (3/3) and it seems not to be working, but I'll leave the link there in case it is just temporarily down.\r\n\r\nI gave my first industry conference talk *ever* at PyData in NYC in November of 2014.

In this talk we're going to move beyond the basic examples of TCP echo servers and example servers that can add number together.  Instead I'll show you a realistic asyncio application.  This application is a port of redis, a popular data structure server, written in python using asyncio.  In addition to basic topics such as handling simple redis commands (GET, SET, APPEND, etc),  we'll look at notifications using pub/sub, how to implement the MONITOR command, and persistence.  Come learn how to apply the asyncio library to real world applications. "

I wrote an initial blog post on the basic of writing redis in asyncio here: [Writing Redis in Python][1]\r\n\r\nHowever, this was all before the async/await keywords were added to the language and I found myself updating the code to reflect the latest changes to the python language and asyncio library.\r\n\r\nAt this point I think asyncio is at a nice and stable point where I can show the remaining work I've done for writing redis using asyncio.\r\n\r\nHere's a few places I've spoken in the past:\r\n\r\n* re:Invent 2015: https://www.portal.reinvent.awsevents.com/connect/sessionDetail.ww?SESSION_ID=1423&tclass=popup\r\n* OSCON: http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-2015/public/schedule/detail/42218\r\n* Pycon Canada: http://2013.pycon.ca/en/schedule/presentation/34/\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://jamesls.com/writing-redis-in-python-with-asyncio-part-1.html",

It will also cover creating mock functions in Python, that can be used by the C code under test to hide external dependencies. Finally, we will look at some of the challenges you might face when trying to mix Python and C and what to do about them."
