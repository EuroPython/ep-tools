    "\n",
    "## Before your session\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plan to be in the talk room at least **10 minutes** before your session.\n",
    "2. **Double check** that you have the **schedule** with you.\n",
    "3. Walk to your room.\n",
    "4. **Check** if there is spare water bottles for the speakers and video adaptors. If something is missing kindly ask the room manager to pick it.\n",
    "5. Reach for the next speaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "## For Each Talk\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ask the speaker how they would like to be introduced, and double check that you know how to pronounce their name.\n",
    "2. Ask the speaker about their Q&A preference (see options below) and how they want to be announced of the last 10 or 5 minutes of talk.\n",
    "3. **Make sure the talk starts on time!** At the talk's scheduled start time, get up on stage, get the microphone, make eye contact with the A/V crew to get their go-ahead, the introduce the speaker.\n",
    "4. **Watch the clock.** Announce the speaker that their talk is about to finish, they way you agreed.\n",
    "5. **Two minutes before the talk's scheduled end time**, if it doesn't seem like the speaker is going to stop on their own, quietly get up and stand to the side of the stage. Be ready to interrupt them if they do not finish on time: \"I'm very sorry but our time is almost up.\", \"Can I suggest continuing in an open space?\", or \"Let's move on to Q&A.\".\n",
    "6. If the speaker requested **Q&A, stand beside the microphone to help moderate** (see section below).\n",
    "7. When the speaker is finished: start the applause, then stand up and thank them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## After Your Session\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Go tell the coordinator or anyone in the reception desk that you finished your session.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q&A\n",
    "\n",
    "Speakers might have different preferences on how they want to Q&A session to be. Please ask them. Here go 3 examples:\n",
    "1. No questions; they will speak for the duration of their talk then leave.\n",
    "2. Take a session-chair-moderated questions for the last 5 minutes of the timeslot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## If You Have Any Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any problems, concerns, or questions, try to contact someone on the `europython-volunteers` Telegram channel (http://bit.ly/28QF0FM).\n",

    "3. TODO Add someone else with a phone number\n",
    "4. Any conference staff member.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moderating Q&A\n",
    "\n",
    "To moderate a Q&A section, please:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Step up to the audience mic and say (something to the effect of): \"Thank you {speaker}! We've got a few minutes for questions now\".\n",
    "2. Kindly ask the speaker to repeat the question once they heard it.\n",
    "3. Questions should be kept short. If the discussion is taking too long (2 minutes), kindly ask to discuss after the talk and reach for the following question, if any."

If you are a experienced developer, the ideas should work as food for thought, helping with recommendations for code reviews, best practices, etc.</p>\n",

You now may be asking yourself, “That sounds like a neat trick. Why would I ever generate my classes at runtime?” Here are a few reasons why:</p>\n",
       "<p>•    It can decrease the physical size of your code.</p>\n",
       "<p>•    It can improve the workflow in adding new functionality.</p>\n",
       "<p>•    It can improve reliability of your code.</p>\n",
       "<p>One example where the power of this concept has really been leveraged is in boto3, the AWS SDK for Python. Dynamic class generation has allowed boto3 to become heavily data driven such that most of its classes and methods are generated based off JSON models representing aspects of an AWS service’s API. For example, to add support for a new AWS service API in boto3, just plop in a JSON file into the library with no additional Python code required.</p>\n",
       "<p>Using lessons and techniques drawn from developing boto3, this talk will dive into the following topics related to dynamic class generation:</p>\n",

       "<p>•    How to overcome some of the challenges of dynamic class generation.</p>\n",
       "<p>•    The tradeoffs in dynamically generating classes and discussion on when it is appropriate.</p>\n",

Together we'll investigate what that means, and what role bytecode plays in the execution of a Python program. We'll discover how we simple humans can read this machine language using the <code>dis</code> module, and inspect the bytecode for some simple programs.

For many Python programmers, this side of Python is just a big black box. It works well, so thankfully we don’t <em>need</em> to go messing around inside... but what if you <em>want</em> to look into the inner workings of this powerful tool? One way to dive into the C-program-side of Python is by exploring the C API for writing Python bindings to native C libraries. In this talk I will explore the basics of this API as I recount my journey to make a simple C library callable from Python code, and allow C code to invoke objects defined in pure Python. Along the way, we will encounter some essential features of Python: reference counting, memory management, and the inner-workings of objects and modules.</p>\n",

A large amount of data has been recently obtained through space satellite missions, such as Planck, financed by ESA/NASA. Planck has observed the radiation emitted about 13 billion years ago (the Cosmic Microwave Background, CMB), which gives us information on the content and space-time geometry of the Universe. Many competitive theoretical models have been proposed that aim at describing the evolution of the species contained in the Universe: therefore, cosmologists need a method to identify which theoretical model better fits the data. In order to compare data with theoretical predictions, cosmologists use Bayesian statistics and Monte Carlo simulations. Among the tools developed for the analysis, the package ‘Monte Python’ is publicly available and uses python to perform Monte Carlo simulations: this allows to determine the theoretical model that maximizes the likelihood to obtain the observed data. Such model is now the standard cosmological model and reveals a Universe that is very different from what scientists had ever expected. A Universe in which the atoms we are made of, constitute only 5% of the total energy budget. The rest is the so-called ‘Dark Universe’.</p>\n",

In this talk we're going to move beyond the basic examples of TCP echo servers and example servers that can add number together.  Instead I'll show you a realistic asyncio application.  This application is a port of redis, a popular data structure server, written in python using asyncio.  In addition to basic topics such as handling simple redis commands (GET, SET, APPEND, etc),  we'll look at notifications using pub/sub, how to implement the MONITOR command, and persistence.

Especially if it is Chinese, which is a tonal language that is written using more than 10.000 different characters. Finding our way around in this linguistic labyrinth is a daunting task. But do not fear, for we have the power of Python at our side, and with its help we will <strong>machine-learn Chinese</strong>!</p>\n",

And while this can be very funny, it can also be rather embarrassing for language learners. So, to keep us from getting into linguistic trouble, we'll write a little Python tool that helps us to improve our pronunciation.</p>\n",

This tutorial is intended to be a broad introduction to writing high-performance parallel Python that is well suited to both the beginner and the veteran developer. Parallel efficiency starts with the speed of the target code itself, so we will start with how to evolve code from for-loops to Python looping constructs and vector programming. We will also discuss tools and techniques to optimize your code for speed and memory performance.</p>\n",

We will discuss strategies for extending parallel workflow to utilize hierarchical and heterogeneous computing, distributed parallel computing, and job schedulers. We then return our focus to the speeding up our target code by leveraging parallelism within compiled code using Cython.</p>\n",

The tight integration of all three languages makes it possible to freely mix Python features like generators and comprehensions with C/C++ features like native data types, pointer arithmetic or manually tuned memory management in the same code. Cython has direct support for NumPy arrays and other buffer objects, which allows for efficient and even parallel (OpenMP) processing of large arrays.</p>\n",

No deep C programming knowledge is required, nor is any prior knowledge needed about writing extension modules for the CPython runtime.
